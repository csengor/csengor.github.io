I studied Translation and Interpreting at\r\n          Istanbul University and graduated in 2013. Studying in Istanbul opened\r\n          up many job possibilities and I did take on various jobs, from ad-hoc\r\n          tourism jobs to a 20-month full-time experience as an assistant project\r\n          director at an international trade fair organisation company.</p>\r\n        <p>In 2012, I decided to freelance as a translator and apart from the\r\n          6-month military service and a year abroad in Belarus, that’s what I\r\n          have been doing. While I initially started off focusing on legal and\r\n          life sciences translation projects in the language combination\r\n          Turkish-English, over time I started to work with creative translation,\r\n          or localisation if you will, projects and from Russian into\r\n          English/Turkish as well. These days I am working on two projects:</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>The first project involves the localisation of education materials\r\n              from Russian into Turkish and has been going on for around two months,\r\n              with a few more months to follow. In this project,&nbsp;\r\n              <a href=\"https://www.proz.com/translator/2946148\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my wife/colleague</a>\r\n              &nbsp;translates the content as I proofread her work.</li>\r\n            <li>As for the second project, I have joined a team of reviewers\r\n              reviewing high-visibility marketing content translation.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>In Turkey, we refer to skills that one can use to make a living as\r\n          “altın bilezik” (a golden bracelet). I think it was around 2014\r\n          that I decided I did not want to have just one, so I started to learn\r\n          Python. Turns out I actually enjoy it, so every bit of spare time I have,\r\n          I invest in learning to code and in developing hobby projects.</p>\r\n        <p>For the last few years, I have been working on a free and open-source\r\n          CAT tool.
