        <h1>Hi,</h1>
        <p>My name is Çağatay. I studied Translation and Interpreting at
          Istanbul University and graduated in 2013. Studying in Istanbul opened
          up many job possibilities and I did take on various jobs, from ad-hoc
          tourism jobs to a 20-month full-time experience as an assistant project
          director at an international trade fair organisation company.</p>
        <p>In 2012, I decided to freelance as a translator and apart from the
          6-month military service and a year abroad in Belarus, that’s what I
          have been doing. While I initially started off focusing on legal and
          life sciences translation projects in the language combination
          Turkish-English, over time I started to work with creative translation,
          or localisation if you will, projects and from Russian into
          English/Turkish as well. These days I am working on two projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first project involves the localisation of education materials
              from Russian into Turkish and has been going on for around two months,
              with a few more months to follow. In this project,
              <a href="https://www.proz.com/translator/2946148" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">my wife/colleague</a>
              translates the content as I proofread her work.</li>
            <li>As for the second project, I have joined a team of reviewers
              reviewing mostly marketing content translated from English to
              Turkish for a multinational tech company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In Turkey, we refer to skills that one can use to make a living as
          “altın bilezik” (a golden bracelet). I think it was around 2014
          that I decided I did not want to have just one, so I started to learn
          Python. Turns out I actually enjoy it, so every bit of spare time I have,
          I invest in learning to code and in developing hobby projects.</p>
        <p>For the last few years, I have been working on a free and open-source
          CAT tool. There has been several iterations all implemented in
          their own way (a previous iteration resides
          <a href="https://demo.toraman.pro" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>),
          but I now have a clear vision of how I want to handle this project.
          Details are available at
          <a href="https://kaplan.pro/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">kaplan.pro</a>,
          if you’d like to read more.</p>
        <p>Other than Python, I have so far experimented with Unity (see
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cengor.SayiToplamaOyunu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">app</a>)
          and Java Android development
          (see <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csengor.emeklilikgerisayim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">app</a>)
          as well.</p>
        <p>Best,</p>
